                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>
                    Chemical Engineering Department at Koya University was established in 2006. The department is unique of its kind in the Iraqi Kurdistan region because this field of engineering does not exist at other universities and higher education institutions within the region. The department is offering currently a Bachelor of Science with Honours [B.Sc. (Hons)] in Chemical Engineering that normally, takes a minimum of four years study.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The department of chemical engineering at Koya University aims at producing highly trained and professional chemical engineers that the Kurdistan region very much needs for the development. This being the case, the department provides a program of study that keeps a good balance between theoretical and laboratory based practical courses. In the later the student will receive training and conduct experiments in a number of laboratories such as the Unit Operation, Process Control, Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Thermodynamics and Reactor laboratories. Undergraduate students will also experience engineering practice and management in two or three jobs while they work in industry during the summer training. Moreover, students will gain more industrial work experience through a number of industry site visits each academic year. That is why, the undergraduate study program at chemical engineering department /Koya University can offer the best mix of a high quality classroom-based education and practical experience.
                </p>

                    <h4>Who employs Chemical Engineers?</h4>
                    It would take too long to list all the products that are impacted by chemical engineers, but knowing what industries employ them may help comprehend the scope of their work. Chemical engineers work in Refinery and oil processes, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, design and construction, pulp and paper, petrochemicals, food processing, specialty chemicals, polymers, biotechnology, and environmental health and safety industries, among others. Within these industries, chemical engineers rely on their knowledge of mathematics and science, particularly chemistry, to overcome technical problems safely and economically. Additionally, they draw upon and apply their engineering knowledge to solve any technical challenges they encounter. Therefore, often after a short training course, chemical engineering graduates will fit a wider range of job opportunities. Below we give some examples of where our graduates went to:
